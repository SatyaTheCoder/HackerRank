select Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor
from
(
select row_number() over (partition by occupation order by name) as rn, * from occupations
) as T
pivot
(
    max(name) for occupation in (Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor)
) as P


Details:

So basically the inside query gives the row numbers by partitioning the table based on the occupation and ordering it by name!
Then the pivot operation does the rest by inverting the table as Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor
Max is just a function used to get the value. It does not matter if we use max or min because there is only one value in that particular row
